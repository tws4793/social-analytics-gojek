# Social Analytics Term Project for Go-Jek

This repo contains the notebooks for the analyses performed for Go-Jek.

The codes in this repo consist of:

- data scraping from Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Google Play Store ([here](https://github.com/tws4793/social-media-scraper)); and
- analysis of various social media, competitors in the ride-hailing industry, and referral programs

## Background

Go-Jek is an Indonesian technology startup, widely regarded as Indonesia's first unicorn company. Apart from its core offering of providing ride-hailing services, it also provides a wide array of other offerings, including but not limited to massage services. Go-Jek was named after 'Ojek', a form of motorbike taxis common in Indonesia.

In March 2018, Uber merged with Grab and pulled out of the ride-hailing market in Southeast Asia, including Singapore, leaving Grab as the only ride-hailing operator. This has left many ride-hailing customers disappointed as a result of the lack of competition. Grab and Uber were subsequently fined a total of S$\$13 million by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) for the merger deal. Go-Jek would subsequently announce its entry into the Singapore market in a bid to provide competition to the ride-hailing market. It commenced limited operations in late-2018.

## Business Problem

The project was conducted during October to November 2018, prior to the soft launch of operations. At that point of time, Go-Jek would like to understand:

- Referral Programs: Do they work, and in what form should a referral program take?
- Post-Merger Sentiments: What do people talk about, the biggest pain points and what are people talking about Go-Jek?

## Credits

We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to Professor Kyong Jin SHIM, Assistant Professor of Information Systems (Practice) at the Singapore Management University (SMU) for the guidance and advice, as well as Go-Jek Singapore for the sponsorship of the project and for the successful collaboration.
