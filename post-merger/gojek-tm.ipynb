Go-Jek was founded in 2010 by Indonesian Nadiem Makarim, who -  like Grab co-founders Anthony Tan and Tan Hooi Ling - attended Harvard  Business School.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nThe commission ruled last month that the acquisition was anti-competitive, and [fined Grab and Uber a total of $13 million](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/grab-uber-fined-13m-for-violating-competition-laws).\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nImmediately after the verdict was announced, Go-Jek issued a  statement saying: \"We are now confident that Singapore will have a  robust, efficient and competitive market, and that our arrival will have  a significantly positive impact on the lives of people in Singapore.\"  It added that the CCCS\\' verdict had removed a \"very high barrier to  entry\".\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nLike Grab, Go-Jek will adopt an asset-light strategy in Singapore -  hence its move to rope in rental firms. Go-Jek, whose app in Indonesia  extends to food delivery and massage services, is likely to offer more  than ride-hailing services here.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nConsumers are looking forward to Go-Jek\\'s entry. Commuter Anthony Ng  said: \"It is a very good thing. More competition means more choices for  consumers.\"\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nThe 68-year-old retiree added that there have been times when he could not get a ride despite several attempts.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nFormer Grab driver Elliot Lin said Go-Jek\\'s arrival will be welcomed  by drivers who are unhappy with Grab. \"I am sure many drivers are  waiting to jump ship,\" the 33-year-old property agent said.', \"If you're one of the people complaining about Grab's crappy service standards then please support this entrant if they're better, not just for the promo codes. \", 'Please help take Grab down a peg... they really think theyâ\\x80\\x99re Tencent ð\\x9f¤£ð\\x9f¤£ð\\x9f¤£', 'A new player has entered the game.', 'Here we go again...', 'just gonna wait for the promo codes', 'In the long term, the one who wins is the one who can embrace self-driving cars fastest.

Vietnam\\'s Competition Authority has asked Grab to submit documents on the merger.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nGrab faces a bumpy road in its newer markets, with pending lawsuits from traditional taxi rivals in Vietnam and Myanmar over unfair business practices even before the Uber takeover. Last December, Myanmar\\'s Hello Cabs sued Grab for what it called improper use of data that it had shared with Grab before it launched in Myanmar in March last year. A spokesman for Grab told The Myanmar Times there was no basis to the allegations and it was cooperating fully with the authorities on the matter.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nVietnam taxi company Vinasun sued Grab for \"unfair competition\" this February, taking aim at Grab\\'s \"rampant\" promotion deals and discounts, which it blamed for its loss of profit. Vietnamese law limits the duration of deals in a year.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nGrab hit back, calling the Vinasun lawsuit \"anti-competitive tactics\". The case was suspended last month for the authorities to gather more information, online news website Dealstreetasia reported.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nGrab\\'s broader strategy involves branching out to digital payments, food delivery and other services, but it will face even stiffer competition in these arenas. Ms Png noted that in Indonesia, Go-Jek has integrated its ride-hailing and financial services, which will allow it to expand quickly and effectively.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nGrab Financial\\'s products will have to face off against incumbent banks and finance companies, while its food delivery services will find strong rivals in Go-Jek\\'s Go-Food, Deliveroo, Foodpanda, Line Man and Vietnammm.com among others in the region.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nProf Nitin said there is \"zero probability\" of Grab claiming all of South-east Asia\\'s ride-hailing market for itself. He said: \"A lot could happen between now and 2025. New entrants could come in, new regulations could be passed, backers might demand that Grab make profits, new entrants could come in when they raise prices, and incumbents like ComfortDelGro might find some inspiration.\"', 'Grab has become complacent, inefficient, and gives zero fucks about the customer. Pretty much like the cab companies they tried to replace.

The option by ride-hailing app Grab is subject to surge pricing, where fares are determined by demand for and supply of rides.\\r\\r\\n> \\r\\r\\n> Checks yesterday showed that a JustGrab ride from Bishan to Havelock Road cost S$12, S$22 and S$13 at 7.30am, 8.30am and 9.30am, respectively. In contrast, metered fares were estimated to be between S$15 and S$20 during the same period.

Consultant Ling Low got a ride within 10 seconds of booking and paid S$7 to go from Raffles Place to Suntec City in the afternoon. â\\x80\\x9cI used to wait longer before I could find a ride. The fixed fare is also great â\\x80\\x94 it is comparable to what I usually pay,â\\x80\\x9d Ms Low, 26, said.\\r\\r\\n> \\r\\r\\n> Trans-Cab driver Desmond Lee, 56, who took two JustGrab bookings, said the fixed fare was lower by S$1 to S$2. While the fare difference was acceptable, he felt that short trips amounting to S$6, for example, are not worth the trouble after taking into account the 10 per cent in commissions to Grab.\\r\\r\\n> \\r\\r\\n> SMRT Taxis cabbie C K Lek was adamant about picking passengers the â\\x80\\x9ctraditionalâ\\x80\\x9d way â\\x80\\x94 by cruising and waiting at taxi stands â\\x80\\x94 given that Grabâ\\x80\\x99s incentives were tied to acceptance and cancellation rates. â\\x80\\x9cI prefer not to be tied down by these things,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\r\\n> \\r\\r\\n> Trans-Cabs driver Anthony Hung, 59, took three to four bookings during the morning rush hour yesterday.
