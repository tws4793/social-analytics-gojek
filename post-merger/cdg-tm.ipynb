You've got a tiny market, divvied up two ways, and then even further trivialised by discounts you have to give. With such a bespoke service, it's kind of difficult to turn a healthy profit margin worth your efforts, isn't it? Keep in mind these companies are big ones. Like Uber. They are looking at the big numbers, not the small ones. \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nPrices cannot hit the sweet spot hence. If we have more people, than the discounts will be worth it if overall the company gets a big profit, but it's just not gonna work. \", \"Hence I said you have more faith in them then me.

', 'And then people wonder why the PAP has the stance that common sense legislation will never work.', 'American ride-hailing company Uber\\'s sale of its South-east Asian business to arch rival Grab - as reported by Bloomberg - should not come as a complete surprise.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nIn a world which has seen a proliferation of ride-hailing providers in the last five years, Uber needs to retreat in some places to focus on markets where it enjoys dominance.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nIn South-east Asia, it is evident that Uber does not have that sturdy foothold. Grab does. In fact, Uber has openly admitted to incurring \"hefty losses\" in the region.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nIts sale of the regional business to Grab - which neither party has officially confirmed - is similar to its pullout from China in 2016, and Russia last year.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nIn the fast-evolving ride-hailing market, players not only have to contend with competition from each other, but they also have to continue to claw market share away from traditional ride providers - namely, taxis. This is a money-draining exercise.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nHence companies have to target resources at markets where they have a fighting chance. It is better to flourish in say, 50 markets, than continue to be an also-ran in 100.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nIt is not dissimilar to American car companies\\' apparent disinterest in the South-east Asian region - even if it is a very sizeable market. They prefer to concentrate on markets where they already have reasonable penetration. Or which are too big to ignore, like China.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nUber\\'s sale will, of course, strengthen Grab\\'s position in the ride-hailing arena. It will allow Grab - a Malaysian company co-founded by Mr Anthony Tan, a scion of the motor-and-property Tan Chong family - to compete with other ride-hailing giants.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nOf these, the biggest is now China\\'s Didi Chuxing, which has already surpassed Uber in market value. It will only be a matter of time before Didi - which bought out Uber\\'s China business two years ago, and which is currently a substantial shareholder in Grab - moves southwards in its quest for growth.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nIndia\\'s Ola is also a hefty player which is on Grab\\'s doorstep.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Uber-Grab deal has a few implications for Singapore\\'s taxi industry. Grab already has allied itself with all cab operators except ComfortDelGro. The leading taxi player had chosen to go to bed with Uber instead.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nComfortDelGro now appears to have picked the wrong horse. Uber, in this case, is akin to a suitor who was wooing two parties at the same time. And it has succeeded on both fronts.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nFor commuters and drivers in Singapore, the deal paves the way for two well-matched rivals who will now compete - on more or less equal footing - for their patronage. It would be the first time too, as ComfortDelGro\\'s sheer size had, for the longest time, given it a stranglehold on the market.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nThat is, if ComfortDelGro does not pull out of its deal to buy a majority stake in Uber\\'s Lion City Rentals.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nIt would also be interesting to see how the Competition Commission of Singapore - which had been deliberating on the ComfortDelGro-Uber deal - now views the Uber-Grab deal.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nIf ComfortDelGro backs out of its Uber deal, and hooks up with Grab instead, it will no doubt create a monopolistic situation which is undesirable for both consumers and drivers.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nIf ComfortDelGro sticks with the deal - which clearly does not look as attractive as before - it will have to face a level of competition it has never experienced before. And the heat might intensify further. Grab had previously been in talks to buy over SMRT\\'s taxi business, so it is clear where its ambitions lie.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nThe next several months will be interesting indeed, as Grab - with an enlarged regional footprint - redraws its battle plans. If this start-up can elbow out Uber, it can do bigger things.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nBesides the Competition Commission, the Land Transport Authority is also watching the development closely, to ensure that commuters and drivers are not worse off.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nThe implications extend beyond the point-to-point transport industry. Card companies such as EZ-Link and Nets should also be worried, as Grab\\'s GrabPay mobile payment platform grows in coverage. Ditto food delivery players.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nGrab has also dipped its toes in the emerging fintech industry.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nArmed with powerful data garnered in the five years it has been a ride-hailing rival to Uber, Grab is poised to be a serious contender in the financial services arena. Its two-week-old venture with Japan\\'s Credit Saison to provide micro loans is just a start.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nIn the words of a Grab insider, \"our new businesses will be 100 times larger than ride-hailing\".\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nFinancial institutions should keep an eye on this ambitious disruptor, indeed.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nFor a start, it would be prudent for EZ-Link and Nets to consider an alliance of their own. After all, there is far too much duplication in what they both currently offer.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nWhichever way the cards fall, there is one clear winner in an Uber-Grab transaction: Softbank. The Japanese group is a sizeable backer of both Grab and Uber. It also has stakes in Didi and Ola.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nAs a financial backer, it will naturally prefer a consolidated state rather than a fragmented one. Hence Grab\\'s purchase of Uber\\'s South-east Asian business makes sense.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nLooking ahead, there will be more consolidation in the ride-hailing sphere. There will be more mergers, acquisitions and alliances ahead. And they may not necessarily be confined to deals between ride-hailing firms.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nIn the end, there will likely be far fewer players than there are today. Those remaining will of course, see their fortunes improve. For despite all the penetration that these app companies have thus far, there is little sign that they are making serious money, if at all.', \"Well, if you have both shares in Uber and grab, obviously you'd kick out the cheaper fare business \", 'with Uber gaining profit 20 to 30% by doing nothing, obviously it is sensible move.', \"> #Uber's retreat to focus elsewhere a sensible move\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n>         American ride-hailing company Uber&apos;s sale of its South-east Asian business to arch rival Grab - as reported by Bloomberg - should not come as a complete surprise.In a world which has seen a proliferation of ride-hailing providers in the last five years, Uber needs to retreat in some places to focus on markets where it enjoys dominance.TO READ THE FULL ARTICLE  You have reached one of our Premium stories.

We pay $300K+ for a $40K car, and $400K plus many extra thousands to \"reimburse\" *ourselves* for interest *lost* when using our own CPF money to rent an HDB chicken coop.

This is achieved by the `analyse_sentiment_vader` function, which uses vader to help us analyse the degree to which the particular review or comment is positive, negative or neutral. It also computes a compound score ranging from -1 to 1 which takes into account all the scores. More reading for the sentiment analysis are available at:\n",
