If a few other people were searching for that too, they can tell an ad company to target me with those ads. Oh no! Now I'm being targeted! But wait, targeted by what? A homing missile? No, someone knows I want tools and is offering me more options. Is that really such a bad thing? I have an actual experience where one of these targeted ads has saved me over $10 by notifying me of a sale I would have missed otherwise. \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nAnd how about always on microphones?
